- I am a Software Engineering student at ALX Africa, a leading online learning platform for African youth. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions using technology. 💻

- I am currently learning the C programming language, one of the most powerful and versatile languages in the world. I enjoy exploring its features and applications in various domains. 🚀

- I am also interested in blogging about FOSS (Free and Open Source Software), a movement that promotes the freedom and collaboration of software development. I believe that FOSS can empower people and communities to solve their own problems. 🌍

You can contact me at abay@duck.com if you want to chat with me or collaborate on a project. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges. 🙌🏻

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile 😊
